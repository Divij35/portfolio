      content: `This AI Voice Assistant is a smart, interactive desktop application that responds to voice commands and performs tasks intelligently. It is built using Python and integrates speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech technologies.

Key Features:
- **Voice Input**: Captures and converts voice commands into text using the 'speech_recognition' library.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes transformer-based models (like BERT) to understand and answer user queries contextually.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the assistant's responses into speech using the 'pyttsx3' engine.
- **Task Automation**: Capable of telling the current time, setting reminders, opening web pages, and more.
- **Simple GUI**: A Tkinter-based GUI to provide an interactive interface and status display.
- **Offline Compatibility**: Some functionalities, like opening apps or telling time, work without internet access.

This project demonstrates how multiple AI components can be seamlessly combined to build a practical, voice-powered assistant. It's a great base for further customization like home automation or integrating with APIs like weather, email, or smart devices.`,
